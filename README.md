## Get started
Simply [download](https://github.com/junaidkokan/frontend-arcade-game/archive/master.zip), or [clone](https://github.com/junaidkokan/frontend-arcade-game.git), this repository and open the index.html file in a browser of your choice.

Alternatively, you could also serve the index.html file through a local server. To do that follow the steps below.
1. Navigate to your local git repository
2. Launch a simple server using python
```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
3. Open the browser with the following address
```
http://localhost:8000
```


## How to play
It is a browser based game. The idea is to navigate the player to the river without colliding with the bugs. Use arrow keys to navigate the player. Once the player reaches the other end, the game is automatically reset.


## Code dependencies
The app is built with the following code dependencies:
1. JavaScript
2. HTML
3. CSS
